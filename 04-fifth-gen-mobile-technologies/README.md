## Prerequisites

These prerequisites only concern you if you will use a Virtual Machine (VM) on a public cloud to execute the different steps. For that, you need to have:

- an **ssh client** already configured on you desktop
- pick an **account** from the accounts csv file containing: VM's public IP address and credentials needed for connecting

## Before you start

I recommend that you create a text file with your favorite editor where you will continuously copy the commands and their output to help you with your TP report.

> Please note that the **VM will be destroyed** upon finishing the TP with a **grace period of 1 hour** approximately.

## Organization

This hands-on is divided into two parts:

  - [Part-1: Deployment of a 5G mobile network](part1.md)
  - [Part-2: Analysis of some basic 5G Procedures](part2.md)
